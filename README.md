# Soundcloud Client

A Soundcloud Client built with Redux and React that can be used to play only tracks from a user's Soundcloud stream. No css integrated yet so it's not pretty to look at, but it is functional in the most basic way. I wrote this only to become more familiar with Redux, so I may not update it, but you never know.
